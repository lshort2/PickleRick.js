My former coworker, [Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-mann-b8583b105/), had joked about adding a Pickle Rick to one of the sites, but only showing it one time. This project was, more so than anything, a challenge to see how hard it would be to create a simple cookie and display an animation if the cookie does not exist.
